    | Start with a green test suite on RSpec 2.x:

  li
    | Install RSpec 2.99.
    = asciinema_video 14084, speed: 3

  li
    | Check your test suite and ensure it's still green. (It should be, but
      we may have made a mistake -- if it breaks anything, please report
      a bug!). Now would be a good time to commit.

    | You'll notice a bunch of deprecation warnings printed off at the
      end of the spec run. These may be truncated since we don't to
      spam you with the same deprecation warning over and over again. To
      get the full list of deprecations, you can pipe them into a file
      by passing the <code>--deprecation-out path/to/file</code> command line option.

  li
    | If you want to understand all of what is being deprecated, it's a good
      idea to read through the deprecation messages.  In some cases, you have
      choices -- such as continuing to use the <code>have</code> collection
      cardinality matchers via the extracted
      #{ link_to "rspec-collection_matchers", "https://github.com/rspec/rspec-collection_matchers" }
      gem, or by rewriting the expectation expression to something like
      <code>expect(list.size).to eq(3)</code>.

  li
    | Install transpec, as it will save you a heap of time. (Note that this need
      not go into your <code>Gemfile</code>: you run <code>transpec</code> as a standalone executable
      outside the context of your bundle).
    = asciinema_video 14087, speed: 6

  li
    | Run transpec on your project. Check <code>transpec --help</code> or 
      #{ link_to "the README", "https://github.com/yujinakayama/transpec#transpec" }
      for a full list of options.
    = asciinema_video 14088, speed: 2

  li
    | Run the test suite (it should still be green but it's always good to
      check!) and commit.
    = asciinema_video 14089, speed: 2

  li
    | If there are any remaining deprecation warnings (transpec doesn't quite
      handle all of the warnings you may get), deal with them.

  li
    | Once you've got a deprecation-free test suite running against RSpec 2.99,
      you're ready to upgrade to RSpec 3. Install RSpec 3.
    = asciinema_video 14091, speed: 3

  li
    | Run your test suite. It should still be green. If anything fails, please
      open a Github issue -- we consider it a bug! Note that you may still get
      a few additional deprecation warnings on RSpec 3 that weren't present on
      2.99. This is normal -- there are a few things we couldn't easily deprecate in
      2.99 and remove in 3.0, so they trigger deprecations in 3.0 with the plan
      to remove them in RSpec 4.
    = asciinema_video 14092, speed: 2

  li
    | We recommend running <code>transpec</code> a second time. There are some changes that
      transpec is only able to make when your project is on RSpec 3.
