RSpec 3 includes many breaking changes, but our hope is to make this the smoothest
major-version gem upgrade you've ever done. To assist with that process, we've developed
RSpec 2.99 in tandem with RSpec 3. Every breaking change in 3.0 has a corresponding
deprecation to 2.99.  Rather than just giving you a generic upgrade document that describes
_all_ of the breaking changes (most of which affect very few users!), RSpec 2.99 gives you a
detailed upgrade checklist tailored to your project.

In addition, [Yuji Nakayama](https://twitter.com/nkym37) has created [Transpec](http://yujinakayama.me/transpec/) -- an absolutely amazing tool that can
automatically upgrade most RSpec suites. We've tried it on a few projects and have been _amazed_ at how well it works.
